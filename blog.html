        <p><span class="red">Question 3: </span>How does event loop work in javascript? </p>
        <p><span class="green">Answer:</span> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
            Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will
            push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

        <p><span class="red">Question 4: </span>How will you get undefined value in javascript? </p>
        <p><span class="green">Answer:</span> A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned
            before using it. <br>
            You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. <br>
            If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value.
